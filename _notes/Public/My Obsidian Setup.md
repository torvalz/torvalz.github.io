This note describes how I set up Obsidian on my ```Pop_OS! 20.04 LTS``` installed laptop.

## Installation
If you use CJK input method, you had better choose ```AppImage``` version of ```Obsidian```. I use ```KIME``` input method for Hangul(한글), it does not work with ```Flatpak``` version. I didn't try ```Snap``` version because I don't like it.
- [Obsidian Official Website](https://obsidian.md/)

## Folders
- **assets** contains images and other files.
- **journals** contains daily journals.
- **notes** is the default path for new notes and contains all my notes.
- **views** contains data views on my journals and notes such as tasks.
- **templates** contains templates deployed with ```Templater```.

## Publication
- I plan to publish some of my notes online at [GitHub Pages](https://torvalz.github.io/).
- I am looking for the publication tool: `Jekyll` vs `Hugo`.

## Todos
- I should learn about popular plugins such as **Kanban**, **Templater**, and the like.
